# Vert.x 3 Wiki and GitHub Issues

We use this repository to host [issues](https://github.com/vert-x3/issues-and-wiki/issues) related to high level planning for Vert.x 3 and other general issues that apply to Vert.x 3 as a whole rather than a specific sub project.

**If your issue is related to a specific sub-project (e.g. vertx-apex) then please create an issue in that specific sub-project.**
